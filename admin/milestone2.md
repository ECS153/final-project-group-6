# Milestone2

## Brian
Last week, I started implementing the basic skeleton of the chat system in Swift using a table view to format the messages. However, we decided to switch to a web page instead of an iOS app since not everyone had Mac books/iPhones to work on and test it. This week, I plan on working on a way to detect/reduce fake accounts. One method I thought of using was to make it harder for someone to make fake accounts (adding more steps to do so) by asking the user to login via Google account or Facebook. By doing this, if a malicious user wanted to create another account, they would have to go through the trouble of making more accounts on Google/Facebook. A problem that I will face is familiarizing myself with node, Javascript, and HTML/CSS.

## Kira
Last week, my team and I worked on researching and implementing an iOS chat app. We decided to switch to a web-app so we could better implement cyber-secure UI/UX principles for our app, as well as to ensure all of our team members have the ability to participate in and help program our project. This week, we are researching and implementing cyber-secure UI/UX principles for our app, more specifically user registration and authentication. I will be working on the login page this week. Currently, I am stuck on how to connect the login page to the chat interface.

## Jade (Huiyu Wang)
Last week, I implemented part of the message app in Swift. After researching several resources about the iOS messaging app, we decided to switch to a web chat app. This week, I have searched on how to make a chat app and start to implement the basic part of the web app. With the help of Emily, we have the basic web based chat app. We have decided to focus on login and sign up security of the web app, so I am going to research on how to implement the login on a web app. The part I am stuck on is probably how to incorporate cryptography or user authentication in a web app.

## Emily
Last week, our team discussed switching from an iOS chat app to a web chat app. Then, I did research on web chat apps and encryption schemes. This week I made the skeleton of our web chat app. Next week, I plan on implementing AES in our chat feature. Our team is also working on the sign up and login aspect of our web page.
