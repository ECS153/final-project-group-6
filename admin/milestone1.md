# Milestone1 

## Brian
In the last week, I looked into research papers on how to hack virtual machines, but I couldn’t see how I could utilize any of the information I found because I am relatively new to computer security and I couldn’t find any source code to help me get started. For that reason, my team and I decided to switch to creating an encrypted messaging app since there were more resources on how to build it. Currently, we are planning to first build the app and then apply security measures later on. The problem we need to solve is how to make it so that only 2 people have access to their private messages, as well as familiarizing ourselves with Swift.

In the past week, we switched from hacking a virtual machine to building an end-to-end encryption private messaging app. Unfortunately, since I lack cyber security experience, I spent most of the time researching virtual machines and how to “hack” them, without actually coding anything. We all got really stuck, and ultimately my team decided to make the switch to a different project. Now, for this next week, I plan to familiarize myself with Swift (since it is my first time using it), assist with creating the basic messaging app, and possibly work on making a nice UI as well.

## Jade (Huiyu Wang)
Last week, we decided to hack a virtual machine. After doing some research and reading some resources, my teammates and I found it hard to start and even do some basic hacking.  
This week, we decided to change our idea and switch to build a private messaging app. We first create the basic UI and implement the login in and main view. I think the problem I stuck on is how to encrypt the message data and even the metadata since this is the main problem we need to solve. 

## Emily
Last week, I did a lot of research on how to hack a virtual machine. My teammates and I struggled to find out exactly how to hack. Much less, how to hack a virtual machine. Thus, this week, we decided to change our final project to build a messaging app. Since some of us have experience building iOS apps, we decided it would be best to try and build a messaging app. This week I plan on conducting research to help my team build the messaging app. I also plan on drawing up some ideas for our UI to help my team create the layout for sign up, login, and our main view. 
Something that I am stuck on is that I do not own an Apple machine. Thus, most of my contributions to the team will be design, research, and making small tweaks to Swift code on our Github. I will work closely with my team (all of whom have Apple laptops) to better our app.
